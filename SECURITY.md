## Reporting a Vulnerability

Use GitHub Issues to report vulnerabilities, please submit an Issue, Bug Report, or Feature Request. This project is a fork that is updated to work with python3 and
is maintained as a convenience. I offer no warranty of any kind and offer no timeline of when (or if) any security vulnerabilities will be addressed. 

If you wish help the cause, please submit a PR for testing and 
evaluation and I'll be in touch.
